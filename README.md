# Todo List (browser) Application

This is a simple html/css/js application of a todo list, using simple pagination by changing the parameters.

Its being hosted by github pages in the following address:

```https://luizguerra.github.io/todo/```

# Why?

Because I wanted something __really__ simple and that was fast to load and use, without having to be concerned with login pages or anything else. Go wild :)
